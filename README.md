# WAD2ITECH_tests

You can run this tests as:

`python manage.py test rango.tests_chapter3`
`python manage.py test rango.tests_chapter4`
`...`
`python manage.py test rango.tests_chapter10`

These tests are only valid for the Rango app of the Tango with Django Book (https://leanpub.com/tangowithdjango19/) up to Chapter 10. Each test runs view's and server tests and each checks the given chapter.

If you are in Chapter 6, tests from previous chapters might fail as the structure of templates/views changes as you progress developing Rang.

# Requirements:

* Python 2.7
* Django-1.10
* Pillow-3.3.1
